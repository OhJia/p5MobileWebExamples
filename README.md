<h1>p5 Mobile Examples</h1>

This is a collection of p5 sketches designed specifically for mobile browsers.

The sketches run on local server using [connect] (https://github.com/senchalabs/connect). 

To try the sketches on your phone: </br>
Install [Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already </br>
1. Change the directory in server.js to the sketch you want to use</br>
2. Run local server on your desktop: node server.js</br>
3. Connect your phone to the same WiFi network as your desktop</br>
4. Find your desktop's IP address, and go to <i>your IP address:8080</i> from your mobile browser</br>

Alternatively, you can host the sketches with Google Drive, instead of having to setup local host. Follow the steps for setting up Google Drive host [here](https://github.com/OhJia/p5Mobile/wiki/Workflows).
